## Overview

A multi-task deep learning framework for estimating forest structural attributes from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Using the synthetic I-MAESTRO dataset across three European forest sites, the model jointly predicts **genus classification**, **canopy height**, and **aboveground biomass** through a shared encoder with physics-based constraints.

*This repository contains the physics-aware deep learning component of a Master's thesis.*

### Key Features

- Multi-task U-Net with shared encoder and task-specific decoders
- Uncertainty-weighted loss for automatic task balancing
- Allometric constraint linking height and biomass predictions
- Gradient alignment and CKA-based analysis of task relationships

## Objectives

Forest monitoring at scale requires accurate estimation of structural attributes for carbon accounting, biodiversity assessment, and sustainable management. This project addresses the challenge of extracting multiple forest properties from freely available SAR data.

**Primary objectives:**
- Develop multi-task learning models that leverage shared representations across related forest attributes
- Incorporate allometric scaling as physics-based constraints
- Evaluate whether joint training improves generalization compared to single-task baselines
- Analyze task relationships through gradient alignment and representation similarity

**Technical challenges:**
1. C-band backscatter saturates at ~50-100 t/ha, limiting biomass estimation in mature forests
2. Dominant genera (Fagus, Abies, Pinus) vastly outnumber rare species
3. Spatial autocorrelation requires careful data splitting
4. Balancing competing objectives in multi-task optimization

## Dataset

### I-MAESTRO Synthetic Forest Landscapes

| Site | Location | Area | Trees | Dominant Genera |
|------|----------|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Bauges** | France | 64,000 ha | 10.5M | Fagus, Abies, Pinus |
| **Milicz** | Poland | 20,000 ha | 4.6M | Pinus, Quercus |
| **Sneznik** | Slovenia | 5,300 ha | 0.8M | Fagus, Abies |

**Input features:** Sentinel-1 GRD dual-polarization (VV, VH) backscatter  
**Target variables:** Dominant genus (6 classes), canopy height (height95), biomass (t/ha)  
**Spatial resolution:** 25m grid  
**Training patches:** 724 (64×64 pixels) | Validation: 145 | Test: 109

## Results

### Performance Summary

| Task | Metric | Single-Task | Multi-Task | Change |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Genus Segmentation** | Mean Dice | 0.366 | 0.366 | 0.0% |
| **Height Regression** | R² | 0.255 | 0.265 | +3.7% |
| **Biomass Regression** | R² | 0.024 | 0.039 | - |

### Key Findings

- Multi-task learning matches single-task baseline performance while using a single shared encoder
- Height-biomass tasks show strong gradient alignment (cosine similarity 0.4-0.9), consistent with allometric coupling
- CKA analysis reveals task hierarchy: height-biomass (most similar) > segmentation-height > segmentation-biomass
- C-band SAR saturation limits absolute performance, particularly for high biomass estimation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
python >= 3.8
pytorch >= 2.0
rasterio
numpy
scikit-learn
```

### Data Preprocessing

See [`@data-preprocessing/README.md`](@data-preprocessing/README.md) for pipeline documentation.

```bash
cd @data-preprocessing
python main.py --sites bauges milicz sneznik
```

### Model Training

See [`@training/README.md`](@training/README.md) for training configurations and experiments.

```bash
cd @training
python train_multitask.py --config configs/mtl_uncertainty.yaml
```

## Methodology

### Architecture

- **Shared encoder:** 4-stage U-Net (128→256→512→1024 channels) with strided convolutions
- **Task-specific decoders:** Independent upsampling paths with skip connections
- **Dropout:** 0.4 (segmentation), 0.2 (regression)

### Training Strategy

- **Uncertainty weighting:** Automatic task balancing via learned homoscedastic uncertainty
- **Allometric constraint:** Regularization enforcing B = exp(α) × H^β
- **Spatial blocking:** 4×4 patch blocks ensure geographic separation of train/val/test sets
- **Early stopping:** Patience=10 epochs monitoring validation metrics

### Analysis Tools

- **Gradient alignment:** Cosine similarity between task-specific gradients in shared encoder
- **CKA similarity:** Centered Kernel Alignment between decoder representations
- **Layer-wise visualization:** Feature map analysis across encoder/decoder depths

## Conclusions

The multi-task framework with physics-based constraints offers a viable approach for forest attribute estimation from SAR data. While absolute performance is limited by C-band saturation, the model learns shared representations across tasks, balances competing objectives via uncertainty weighting, and incorporates allometric ecological knowledge. Future work should explore L-band SAR, multi-temporal features, and optical data fusion.
